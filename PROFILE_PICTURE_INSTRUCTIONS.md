# Profile Picture Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Profile Picture

### Step 1: Prepare Your Image
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio recommended)
- **Quality**: High resolution for best results
- **File Name**: Save as `profile-picture.jpg`

### Step 2: Add to Project
1. Place your image file in the same folder as `index.html`
2. Make sure it's named exactly `profile-picture.jpg`
3. The website will automatically detect and display your photo

### Step 3: Fallback
- If no image is found, a professional placeholder icon will be displayed
- The placeholder uses your initials "SK" in a styled circle

### Example File Structure
```
my-portfolio/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── script.js
├── profile-picture.jpg  ← Your photo goes here
└── README.md
```

### Tips for Best Results
- Use a professional headshot
- Ensure good lighting and clear background
- Crop to square format for perfect circle display
- Keep file size under 2MB for fast loading

### Troubleshooting
- **Image not showing**: Check file name is exactly `profile-picture.jpg`
- **Image distorted**: Ensure your image is square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- **Slow loading**: Compress image to reduce file size

The profile picture will appear in the hero section with a beautiful animated ring and floating tech icons around it!
